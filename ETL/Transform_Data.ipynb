      "we're yeah I think we're live okay and we have a few people hi everybody hello\n",
      "it takes a few minutes to get things rolling technology I see some people saying\n",
      "hi Jan gumar Adriana Rolf and we had a few technical difficulties getting the\n",
      "live stream connected so I'm like is it actually working I don't know but it\n",
      "looks like it is I I'm seeing some stuff in the chat that suggest it is working\n",
      "it worked out I'm very happy to hear that yeah yeah cool so how are you doing\n",
      "Josh I'm doing great how are you doing you just got back from a vacation yeah\n",
      "yeah it was fun I was in Europe for a bit and you got back from some interesting\n",
      "trips right yeah I was in uh I uh I guess the last time we did the live stream\n",
      "was in July uh so it's been a while so I've J what's that yeah with the one with\n",
      "J I think it's either June or July it's been a few months I've I've since\n",
      "traveled to India uh to talk at the data hack suic 2024 wow that's nice uh and\n",
      "then I went to uh Brazil uh South Paulo to talk at sender uh and that both trips\n",
      "were absolutely fantastic um that's awesome so but it's good to be home and it's\n",
      "good to be live streaming again it's good to be hanging out with lwis yeah I\n",
      "always like hanging out with Josh so this is wonderful um I think I'm not\n",
      "certain I think we're both I think we're both going to be at that uphill\n",
      "conference in Switzerland in Switzerland yes yeah so 2025 so I'm excited about\n",
      "that because if if nothing else happens between now and then I know I'll at\n",
      "least get to see you then in person I think so yeah definitely that's exciting\n",
      "because we never never met in person we talked a lot on maybe when we're there\n",
      "or whenever we meet up we can do a live stream but we can be together instead of\n",
      "being separate we can do that would a little we'll just live stream from the\n",
      "same camera yeah yeah that's very exciting yeah yeah let's see who's around uh\n",
      "so who wants want to tell us in the chat where they're coming from and I'll read\n",
      "that where they they are and I'll I'll just read them I see looks like we got\n",
      "venezuel someone from Venezuela which is cool hola a neighbor I'm from Colombia\n",
      "right there uh yeah well we can start I see some questions there yeah uh so\n",
      "we're gonna we have three things today for the audience and and more if we want\n",
      "we have a few questions that we're in the live stream that we're going to answer\n",
      "mostly about you know learning machine learning uh fields to work on Etc then we\n",
      "want to talk about this recent news about the physics Nobel Prize which was won\n",
      "by Jeff Hinton and John hopfield ai ai people which is very exciting uh it's\n",
      "huge for AI I never thought I was gonna say something is huge for a but this is\n",

      "Arabia Ireland I love it people all over the world um I mean let's dive into\n",
      "some questions and by the way people can always put questions in the chat and\n",
      "we'll we'll if if they're easy we'll get to them I'm kidding we'll get to them\n",
      "uh whether we answer them correctly or not we we'll definitely answer them no uh\n",
      "definitely put questions in the chat and uh we'll um and we'll and we'll get to\n",
      "them but well let's start with the ones that were put in the in the in the\n",
      "previous uh chat so let let me ask you one uh if you got stuck in learning what\n",
      "methods do you follow to break the problem and understand it yeah so uh that and\n",
      "this happens to me all the time so I'm actually very well practiced in in what\n",
      "to do when you get stuck um and what I always do is I you know if it's say it's\n",
      "like a topic I'm trying to learn something about I try to read uh everything I\n",
      "can about whatever that topic is and to be honest what that means is basically\n",
      "uh skimming through stuff and not understanding any of it um uh uh usually the\n",
      "doc you know say like I'm trying to learn about how PCA works and I'll read I'll\n",
      "read stack exchange post because there's lots of people asking about it there\n",
      "and there's people explaining it but I also read manuscripts um and a lot or I\n",
      "read the Wikipedia article and all that stuff and a lot of that time I uh I\n",
      "don't understand anything that I've UND you know anything from any of that stuff\n",
      "um and uh what happens though is I is I start seeing words that are used in all\n",
      "of these different Publications you know on the Wikipedia page they they might\n",
      "reference some terminology there might in the manuscripts they may referen in\n",
      "similar terms and I kind of build up a little bit of a histogram in my brain of\n",
      "words that I've never seen before and then it sort of becomes that rabbit hole\n",
      "where once I see what terms they're using in this field I'll start diving into\n",
      "those individual terms and and those terms lead to other terms which lead to\n",
      "other terms so it's just like like a like a landslide of terminology uh finally\n",
      "trying to get to the bottom of where of something where I finally understand\n",
      "things and even then I might get to the bottom where there's no longer any new\n",
      "terminology and I don't understand it so what do I do I just keep reading it and\n",
      "rereading it and this takes time takes a couple of days and sooner or later one\n",
      "little bit makes sense one little tiny bit and then with that it's almost like\n",
      "you know it's like a little finger hold on a cliff and I get my finger in there\n",
      "and I can hold my weight and then you know and that just lets me reach up and\n",
      "you know eventually I'm climbing and I get back out of this you know deep Cave\n",
      "of terminology and I bubble up to the top and usually then I can sort of read\n",
      "those top level AR uh articles uh but then what I'll do is I'll start looking at\n",
      "code I'll look at implementations um and then I'll start trying to either code\n",
      "it myself or I use somebody else's implementation and I'll see if the input and\n",
      "the output makes sense the way I expect it usually it doesn't usually I'm\n",
      "completely wrong in my understanding at this at this stage but then I can start\n",
      "trying to reconcile the difference between what I'm seeing with the\n",
      "implementation and what I thought I understood from the documentation um and\n",
      "then you know sooner or later things start coming together but but it's one of\n",
      "these things where um I just the the real key is just don't give up there's so\n",
      "many you know the first couple of weeks of this process is nothing but failure\n",
      "um and sometimes it goes on longer than that you hopefully it's not too much\n",
      "longer but it can go for a while um and I just don't ever give up because I I\n",
      "know fundamentally a lot of the math is just m you know simple math it's\n",
      "multiplication it's it's addition it's division if things get really funky they\n",
      "may take a log and they may take a square root uh but it's it's fundamentally\n",
      "small pieces that I know I understand and it's just a function of like uh\n",
      "getting to that level and then building back up to the top um yeah yeah so\n",
      "that's my story no that's definitely a a good answer yeah I I have done\n",
      "something similar and I feel you mentioned something which is kind of like being\n",
      "stuck yeah uh I feel like the day I made being stuck my comfort zone my life got\n",
      "a lot better because before I hated being stuck and now I say just know yeah um\n",
      "I'm going to be stuck and I feel like um when I read uh any paper or anything I\n",
      "I understand nothing even if it's stuff I already know as a matter of fact even\n",
      "if stuff I've wrote written in the past like papers I wrote in the past I don't\n",
      "understand them because they're written in weird language of formulas and I I\n",
      "can't do formulas never and so I my trick uh that I would uh to to what you said\n",
      "it's it's picking a super simple example so if it's Imaging for example 2x two\n",
      "2x two monochromatic number two four numbers between zero and one is an image\n",
      "and I try to work everything out there so I do all the formulas in those numbers\n",
      "uh if it's text I try to have you know a language with four words and sentence\n",
      "with four words and try to do that or or a matrix of 2 by two like I always try\n",
      "to work out all the formulas there and then it turns out that it's always sums\n",
      "as you said sums and products and logarithms that only appear to turn a product\n",
      "into a sum that's the reason they appear right um so like it's always I have a\n",
      "few tricks but always just trying to get the simplest example and I've I've\n",
      "talked a lot chat GPT has been super helpful because now I before I used to bug\n",
      "my friends I bug people like I ask them questions and stuff like expert people I\n",
      "know but I but I now just ask CH GPT and I obviously if you ask it right away it\n",
      "gives you the formulas and the same thing you find in Wikipedia right but now\n",
      "now I just said okay no but I want I want an example with a dog and a cat and I\n",
      "want this or an image that is 2 by two or something help me understand this and\n",
      "it it's actually like after a while it starts getting understanding what you\n",
      "want and uh so yeah but definitely just just trying and trying and I feel like I\n",
      "I throw a lot of information in my brain and hope that it organizes it so I I\n",
      "watch a little bit of a video I read a little bit of a paper I scribble a little\n",
      "bit then I forget it I come back and I I don't have an organized way of of\n",
      "learning but I feel like if you just kind of throw stuff eventually starts\n",
      "clicking and sometimes things stay years to click yeah uh so now I just I just\n",
      "hope it clicks before the algorithm goes out of uh fashion you know because yeah\n",
      "I understand something old now like it doesn't help so I now we have deadlines\n",
      "but yeah yeah speaking of that what are the hardest topics you've explained and\n",
      "why that's another question we have oh man uh I'll be honest so uh my PCA video\n",
      "took at least a year to make MH um that was a that was really hard for me um and\n",
      "it's one of those things like once I made the video I like oh this is obvious uh\n",
      "but it you know getting to that stage was really challenging for me um what else\n",
      "has been really hard logistic regression took forever MH um uh neural networks\n",
      "was neural networks was interesting it was interesting in a weird way in that um\n",
      "I don't I don't I'm a big fan of three blue one brown he makes Incredible great\n",
      "content and I remember uh watching his videos on neural networks and being like\n",
      "oh these are awesome um why would anyone need to do another video and on neural\n",
      "networks and so I didn't I wouldn't even think about neural networks for a long\n",
      "time and then someone posted a comment in on one of my videos that said you\n",
      "should do a video on neural network work and I wrote back and I said why check\n",
      "out these videos by three blue one brown I sent him the link and the guy wrote\n",
      "back and he says I've seen those before you still need to make a video because I\n",
      "don't really get it and and so what made this hard is is I was like what else is\n",
      "there to say and so I watched what three blue one brown did I watched those\n",
      "videos again and they're again they were fantastic videos and so I but I was\n",
      "like but clearly there's something missing that this viewer wants MH so I had to\n",
      "watch those videos and go I see what he's saying I see what he's illustrating\n",
      "what's he not illustrating what's missing and I had to think of what was missing\n",
      "yeah and I had to and that was hard for me to figure out what wasn't in there um\n",
      "and that was but but I eventually figured it out I eventually figured out what\n",
      "what what three blue one Brown wasn't doing although he was doing a lot of\n",
      "things right MH what he what he was and and I'm not saying he was doing anything\n",
      "wrong either like he was just doing it the way he did it right um but what\n",
      "wasn't there was just like what Lewis was saying like a super simple example\n",
      "where he could walk through and see the math in action without it being really\n",
      "abstract you can actually do the multiplication actually do the addition and\n",
      "then plot a point on a graph and say uh based on the input value which is on the\n",
      "x- axis this is what the output value is so far and you can plot that on the y-\n",
      "axis and and once I started doing it that way where you could see how the neural\n",
      "network is transforming the input into the desired output you could actually see\n",
      "it happen one step at a time and it wasn't like abstracted into sort of\n",
      "generalized equations but actually we were doing the math one step at a time and\n",
      "actually coming up with real values uh and all of a sudden I was like oh that's\n",
      "how I'm GNA do this you know and I'm gonna so that but it took me a while to to\n",
      "figure that out as well like to come up with a new way to to point out something\n",
      "that hasn't been seen before yeah definitely I feel like with neural networks I\n",
      "had something similar because I was looking at them for a while and I was\n",
      "obsessed with the exor example right the one that's like this is positive\n",
      "positive negative negative and you can't cut them with a line cuz I was trying\n",
      "to look for something that you can't cut with a line cuz that reques a NE\n",
      "Network I saw some block post by chrisa where he bends space in a weird way and\n",
      "I thought that's got to be something and I and I I remember looking at it for\n",
      "months and months and months until one day finally something clicked which is if\n",
      "I have for example one logistic regression that's a line that splits the plane\n",
      "in two yeah and if I have another logistic regression that's another line that\n",
      "splits the plane in two and if I over impose them then I have two lines that\n",
      "split the plane in four and now I could use four regions and maybe one of those\n",
      "four regions is is where I want my data to be right and so when I started\n",
      "looking at over imposing I think there's some something called neural network\n",
      "tensorflow play ground where you can play with them and and you over impose the\n",
      "regions and then you joining lines you can start getting any kind of curve you\n",
      "want yeah that's when they finally clicked yeah and then yeah so that one that\n",
      "one took a while another one that took a while was reinforcement learning I feel\n",
      "like I I took a long time learning understanding that so much that I was once\n",
      "teaching a class in University on on on on machine learning and and I and I had\n",
      "reinforcement learning as the last lecture hoping that I would understand it and\n",
      "then I kind of had to like remove it without anyone noticing because I couldn't\n",
      "really click it my own way yeah and it took more years until one day it finally\n",
      "clicked I feel like that's one that's one that uh that took a long time to click\n",
      "yeah uh and then yeah a few a few other topics Quantum Computing to took some\n",
      "time like I have you just had some new videos on Quantum Community I have some\n",
      "videos and I'm dropping one pretty soon it's not it's kind of like starting I'm\n",
      "I'm like the preview of quantum Computing so I'm doing 4 a transform fast for\n",
      "transform and then we get to the quantum for transform so I'm still\n",
      "understanding it but fast f transform is my next video coming out soon awesome\n",
      "that's exciting so yeah if you don't subscribe to Louis make sure you do that\n",
      "subscribe to Louis yes I'll put it in the uh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah we can\n",
      "put that in the chat holy SM let's put in the chat yeah let me put it in the do\n",
      "it right now uh can you oh I see a lot of questions I know we got all kinds of\n",
      "good stuff f up here let let's go through we have two more here that are quick I\n",
      "uh how do you understood how do you know you've understood a topic thoroughly or\n",
      "you still need to dig more yeah I feel like there's like a little elf on my\n",
      "shoulder or a little little tiny person or whatever that's like uh like I I well\n",
      "okay there's a couple of ways to do this one is the elf just tells me I'm stupid\n",
      "all the time you got the same elf as me and and that like you don't actually\n",
      "know what you're talking about so there's a lot of like anxiety and sort of like\n",
      "like what is it like impostor syndrome going on right there like the guy's like\n",
      "you know don't really understand it and that does push me to try harder to learn\n",
      "more and like I have to like then convince the elf I'm like no I do and the alha\n",
      "is like well what about what about this situation I'm like okay you're right\n",
      "I've got to go back and figure out that one situation um and but but also you\n",
      "know I I know I'm getting close when I can use the implementation of whatever\n",
      "algorithm I'm I'm I'm interested in teaching or learning about um and the input\n",
      "gives me the exact output that I expect right and I can look at all the things\n",
      "that happened in between I go yeah this is all exactly as expected and I can\n",
      "throw in more complicated things and I can I can really predict what's going to\n",
      "happen so that's that's a good sign that I'm at least in the ballpark of\n",
      "understanding um but the other thing is is is when I'm when I'm building the\n",
      "presentation when I'm making the slides for the stat Quest video you know I read\n",
      "it out loud and when I read it out loud it's like I'm talking to that little elf\n",
      "on my shoulder and and I'll I can like I can notice that there's there's like\n",
      "jumps I don't know somehow the when I'm read when I'm reading it in my head I\n",
      "don't notice the jumps but when I read it out loud I'll realize that I'm going\n",
      "from one concept to the next without talking about all the little important\n",
      "things that are in between and that'll go like what is going on in between those\n",
      "two things so when I something about saying it out loud points these gaps out to\n",
      "me and then I have to dive in and I have to figure out those gaps and when I can\n",
      "finally get to the point where I can read through the whole all the slides out\n",
      "loud and I feel like there's a smooth transition and there's no jumps in logic\n",
      "there's no like like all the steps are baby steps instead of there being like\n",
      "and then we start from point A and then we end up all the way over here once I\n",
      "and something about reading it out loud forces me to think in terms of baby\n",
      "steps MH um um and so that's how I do it what about you Louis I'm curious what\n",
      "your strategy I have the same elf yeah no I I I feel the same I have a superpow\n",
      "which I never know it was a superpow but it's I I don't understand anything like\n",
      "I'm very slow at understanding like if I'm in a talk look at my face if you ever\n",
      "seen me in a talk and I'm like uh I I I really have a hard time understanding\n",
      "stuff which find I found out later in life that is good for when you explain\n",
      "stuff yeah uh but I I find that I if I'm not understanding it's possible that\n",
      "I'm not understanding my own explanation so if my explanation contains math and\n",
      "formulas and matrices and I I I I know it's true I trust it I I see the steps\n",
      "and I believe it but I don't understand it and there's a moment where I feel\n",
      "happy uh and I don't know how to describe it but I just feel happy I think is\n",
      "when I've removed all the formulas if I if I managed to remove everything and\n",
      "have an example with little people or something or cats and dogs or cows or\n",
      "something like apples and oranges if I manage to do that and have it fully\n",
      "gometric fully visual then I'm happy about it and I and and and there's a moment\n",
      "where I clicks and I go finally and I just have a a few seconds of of of of awe\n",

      "for a long time and they're not going anywhere um they'll still be in fashion\n",

      "uh we see a bunch of questions yeah uh we're at about halfway point so we could\n",
      "uh you want to talk a bit why don't we talk about your book why don't you tell\n",
      "us a bit about Illustrated guiding your networks which great yeah so uh so I\n",

      "stat Quest Illustrated guide to neural networks and Ai and it goes from the most\n",
      "basic neural network all the way up to almost the state-ofthe-art maybe the\n",
      "state-ofthe-art sort of depends on where we are uh Lewis is one of my technical\n",
      "editors I love it and so he got Early Access so he could find out all the\n",
      "mistakes um and I've got a handful of people doing that uh finding little heirs\n",

      "typing when I'm when you're writing a book I hate to like uh maybe like um I\n",

      "write or do anything create anything it's it's always a little rougher around\n",
      "the edges and sometimes uh sometimes I maybe uh you know things needed to be\n",

      "see the mistakes anymore because even if I know that it would be a mistake I\n",
      "just can't see it on the page because my brain automatically fills that Gap um\n",

      "others and then we're going to send it to what's called a copy editor who's\n",
      "going to make sure that uh the grammar is correct um and and after that I think\n",
      "we're going to have it out the I I know some professors are already assigning it\n",
      "uh for their spring semester classes so I kind of have a deadline we got to make\n",
      "this happen oh so um so that's that that's the book uh I I know I know I haven't\n",
      "seen a question about it in the in and I know we've got tons of questions in the\n",
      "chat and we will get to those but I do want to address the Nobel Prize the Nobel\n",

      "out for physics I I don't know I'm not a physicist but I think it's having a\n",

      "physicists are are thinking I I'm definitely excited I I I I read the I was on\n",
      "RS Technica and I read the comments on that and they were I mean not everyone\n",
      "but so many people were so B out of shape about this uh they just felt like they\n",
      "were like this is just hype this is you know they're just getting on the AI\n",
      "bandwagon you know this a dis you know why didn't they you know they people were\n",
      "just B out of shape over this um and I actually have got some thoughts about\n",
      "this because I uh for I spent about 14 years of my life as a geneticist and so I\n",
      "used to pay very close attention to what was going on in uh medicine and\n",
      "Physiology and sort of biology and these things I never I never physics was\n",
      "always sort of like obscure random weird stuff but the Nobel Prize in uh\n",
      "medicine and Physiology and and I guess I don't know if there's a Biology one or\n",
      "maybe that's the medicine one um often would go to someone or a group of people\n",
      "that did not uh necessarily find something that gave us fundamental\n",
      "understanding of how the human brain worked or how the human heart worked but\n",
      "they'd come up with a method that then allowed other people to to go crazy with\n",
      "your research That Was Then Prof profoundly change the field a good example is\n",
      "is a method called polymerase Chain Reaction it's called PCR for short uh this\n",
      "was something I don't know if you remember but you used to have to get covid\n",
      "tests right and the PCR test was more accurate than the um than the antibody\n",
      "test and so and so PCR became something that was critical for making good covid\n",
      "tests uh but within the lab anyone who's doing any kind of genetics research\n",
      "uses this method of PCR pmer chain reaction and to and it's like used daily in\n",
      "almost every lab in the whole world and it the method itself was not like didn't\n",
      "provide a whole lot of insight you know on how the biology Works they already\n",
      "knew they just had to put the pieces together MH uh to make it work and that got\n",
      "them a Nobel Prize there's another thing called Green fluorescent protein which\n",
      "is uh a jellyfish protein that someone's like hey I can put this in a mouse and\n",
      "I can make their kidneys glow or I can make cells that are expressing this Gene\n",
      "glow green and that makes it easier for me to study this disease it didn't help\n",
      "me didn't on its own it didn't shed light on the disease or on the on the\n",
      "function of the heart or any of these things but it made it easier to study\n",
      "study those diseases and again that got a that got a Nobel Prize uh this guy\n",
      "Oliver smithies uh uh a guy I used to work with uh he got a Nobel Prize for this\n",
      "a method of called homologous recombination that was known how it worked but he\n",
      "was able to co-opt it into inserting pieces of DNA and so then again it's\n",
      "another method to help people understand biology and so uh in biology I know\n",
      "I've been rambling for forever but in biology the examples I just want to give\n",
      "you is that time and time again the Nobel Prize goes to someone not for\n",
      "necessarily finding some groundbreaking uh function of like how the brain works\n",
      "but more they came up with a way to facilitate researchers in general and their\n",
      "and their and and expedite and rapidly speed up the time we go from General\n",
      "hypothesis to testing that hypothesis to making conclusions and Publishing new\n",
      "insights into how biology works and I feel like this is the first time that's\n",
      "happened in physics right because uh neural networks are used for image\n",
      "classifications like like these satellite not satellit excuse me these radio\n",
      "telescopes they generate so much data all the time and they most of that stuff\n",
      "is basically run as a preliminary sort of like low pass filter on the data they\n",
      "put a neural network on there to identify things that are interesting if\n",
      "identify outliers identify Stars L classify things all that stuff is run through\n",
      "neural networks and it's a way of just like dealing with the flood of\n",
      "information that we can now generate on a huge scale and all branches of physics\n",
      "are becoming like this where they gen instead of like one measurement they\n",
      "generate tons and tons of measurement and to Wade through that a lot of people\n",
      "are using neural networks to do that and I feel like so what you know what\n",
      "they've got now is they've got someone who's who's created a method that has\n",
      "been that is now sort of permeated physics and it helps pretty much everyone do\n",
      "physics better and faster to get more cool results and so the first time ever\n",
      "that's happened in physics and people are getting all bent out of shape because\n",
      "it doesn't give us the neural network doesn't give us some profound Insight onto\n",
      "like the small force of an atom or something like that um but it just makes all\n",
      "of physics easier to do and more practical and and in biology we've been doing\n",
      "that for years and years and years and years um so it was no no surprise to me\n",
      "but in physics I guess it's new for them and so there's like a cultural shift in\n",
      "terms of like what does the Noel prize mean yeah um but I hopefully they'll get\n",
      "with the program yeah I mean I feel like yeah there's definitely disciplines I\n",
      "feel like science should be like all the disciplines together like we put\n",
      "artificial walls between them that only create division because it's hard to uh\n",
      "you know sometimes even in in I'm a mathematician and even inside math you're\n",
      "like oh no that's a different topic that than me I don't need to touch that or\n",
      "that's physics or that's science you know so I feel like it's good to to unite\n",
      "them uh but you know there's an there's an ego that that that some disciplines\n",
      "have and I think it's it's hard when a someone from a different field uh wins it\n",
      "and in particular the Nobel prizes have a a bias uh it's not a bad thing but it\n",
      "have a bias of of being like like scientifically useful like um being you can't\n",
      "just come up with a theory and so many great people have not won a Nobel Prize\n",
      "because they came up with just a theory yeah right like that maybe was proved\n",
      "maybe was proved experimentally much later like like Hing didn't win a Noel\n",
      "prize maybe in many years they will prove something experimentally about black\n",
      "holes when we're able to get close or something but right now it's just it's\n",
      "just Theory so yeah so no Bell has prices have that that bias which is why\n",
      "there's no Nobel Prize in mathematics for example people in math are always you\n",
      "know wondering why there was never a price for mathematics and it's because yeah\n",
      "by the time when you create a mathematical Theory by the if it gets used by the\n",
      "time it gets used it could be 400 500 years like calculus right like it got used\n",
      "much later so are you going to give a Nobel Prize post they will all be post\n",
      "postly yeah um so yeah but I think this this one yeah and I mean I said I'm I'm\n",
      "not a physicist so I don't know uh I did see one one time in math the fields\n",
      "medal was given to a physicist Edward Whitten and even himself like he's amazing\n",
      "like he's very qu Quantum field Theory and a bunch of really complicated stuff\n",
      "but even himself would say like you know I didn't prove anything I just created\n",
      "conjectures and Mathematics has a thing for proving right you have to prove\n",
      "something and prove but many times finding the conjecture is much harder right\n",
      "like like thinking oh this could be true I don't know how to prove it but but\n",
      "this could be true uh so I think en riches Fields um but yeah this this one was\n",
      "kind of like uh I think it's using I don't know they used physics ideas to\n",
      "create neural networks right because these are basically they they they use\n",
      "statistical mechanics and a bunch of energy things to to train neuron so I think\n",
      "the genius is there they didn't create any new theories which is you know what\n",
      "probably uh you know what probably makes people wonder why they they got it but\n",
      "I think they they managed to use some stuff pretty well uh yeah can I do a\n",
      "little Shameless promotion Lewis actually has a video on the boltzman machines\n",
      "that that these guys um of you you know part of the award was given for so if\n",
      "you want to learn about and I kind of want to learn about these boltzman\n",
      "machines myself absolutely so I'll be watching this video later this afternoon\n",
      "but do check out his his video on these things if if you're at all curious as to\n",
      "sort of like how these things actually work and sort of what the award was thank\n",
      "you so much for the promotion I think it's definitely not Shameless if you do it\n",
      "for for someone else out of out of the kindness of your heart and I have a yeah\n",
      "so this video was kind of flat it wasn't getting so many views because it's not\n",
      "a topic that everybody cares about but I started getting a lot of views a couple\n",
      "days ago and I'm like oh what happened and then I realized the Nobel priz so I'm\n",
      "making one in hopfield Networks next and I just I just understood them yesterday\n",
      "I can give you a sneak a preview you want a tiny preview okay yeah give us a\n",
      "tiny preview this is hopfield networks okay check it out uh I'm going to give\n",
      "you a data set a small data set yeah and you you learn it okay it's very easy\n",
      "it's bit strings of length two so zeros and ones but only only two of them\n",
      "here's the data set 0 0 that's the first one yeah 0 0 0 1 one 1 one one one okay\n",
      "that's the data set now I'm going to ask you I'm not going to ask you for the\n",
      "data set let's pretend it's so big that you couldn't store it in your head can\n",
      "you give me a random element from that data set z0 there you go z z you didn't\n",
      "say 0 one because why what what was the special about the z0 why did you say\n",
      "that I think you said it a couple times yeah yeah I said 0 and and you\n",
      "remembered one thing which is that it's the same number right like what whatever\n",
      "the first one is the second one also is that's right so you remember one thing\n",
      "that they're correlated yeah pretty much 100% correlated yeah so I gave you 12\n",
      "bits I gave you six bit strings I gave you a lot of information and you\n",
      "remembered one yeah that's a Hopi Network right so you remember this there's a\n",
      "node if if I this is a way to put it physically there's a node sorry pictorially\n",
      "there's a Noe here for the first bit there's a Noe here for the second bit and\n",
      "there's a strong correlation Edge between them like yes with a label 10 or 100\n",
      "yeah now if I were to give you this this data set 01 01 01 1 0 1 0 1 0o right\n",
      "yeah then it's the opposite they're not they're inversely correlated so it's a\n",
      "note here a note here and a really Negative Edge got it bam that's a that's it\n",
      "bam oh I got a bam yeah we got we got a bam in the comments we got a bam I am I\n",
      "honored so for example let's say I give you bit strings of length 10 yeah and I\n",
      "give you a trillion of them and you're like well this is way too much but you\n",
      "start noticing that the two first are correlated and the first and the seventh\n",
      "are correlated and you create an with 10 edges sorry 10 ver is roughly 10\n",
      "squared edges so it's 100 parameters really bad yeah to remember your trillion\n",
      "things and then if I ask you for a random point in the said you can sort of pick\n",
      "out from the graph a random element there's a way to pick it up uh and and\n",
      "that's it and it's not even this is the interesting thing it's not a neural\n",
      "network that you train like a neural network by slowly adding Epsilon no you\n",
      "just you just take a DOT product of of vectors and add it and you get the labels\n",
      "it's deterministic it's completely deterministic now here's the thing let's say\n",
      "that there's triple correlations or quadruple correlations right like let's say\n",
      "the first two are zero then the 10th one is one yeah that's harder to pick up\n",
      "yeah then you need an RBM so in an RBM a restricted Bolson machine which is the\n",

      "let's say 10 notes and a bunch of hidden notes that connect yeah to all of them\n",
      "creating bigger correlation so if you want to create a correlation between the\n",
      "first the second and the 10th you have a note here that has a big edge with one\n",
      "a big edge with two and a big edge with 10 and small edges with the rest and you\n",
      "can create correlations like that on RBM does train a neural network it's much\n",

      "on every day there's probably I don't how many papers are published on neural\n",

      "you having to know in advance what that shape even sort of looks like um you can\n",

      "let all of the noise all the Publications let that settle you know six months a\n",
      "year from now go back and you can see what's still sticking around and go well\n",
      "people are still using these methods a year later I'll let me learn about these\n",
      "methods and by then you might actually have learned enough about neural networks\n",

      "Cutting Edge to used every day is is in the order of years um and the like we\n",
      "said earlier a lot of the old methods are still being used for that reason so um\n",
      "so so to quote Lewis Don't Panic focus on the main ideas um and just you know as\n",
      "long as you understand the basics you're probably good to go yeah absolutely and\n",

      "next one uh but yeah the the sentence definitely of the day is Don't Panic yeah\n",
      "exactly yeah somebody asked about statistical analysis along along this routs\n",
      "like how much do you need to know statistical analysis to get uh good at machine\n",

      "not not as much you know a lot more a lot more statistics uh I feel like some\n",
      "some more like intuition feel like like probability and statistics intuition is\n",
      "better than knowing a lot of stuff you know like I I think it's correct I to me\n",
      "the key is as long as you understand that like there's this concept of variation\n",
      "um and that you need to keep it in the back of your head that if you did this\n",
      "again you'd probably get a slightly different result um and as long as you've as\n",
      "long as you're aware that there's variation and things aren't always the same\n",
      "every single time I think you're like 95% of the way there uh and and and once\n",

      "of variation in the output or is it just a little bit of variation and if\n",
      "there's a little bit of variation in the output your intuition is probably right\n",
      "right you can make good good decisions based on this whatever this is you know\n",
      "if there's a little bit of variation then you know you might make the wrong\n",
      "decision but it's not going to be that far off um whereas if there's lots of\n",
      "variation in the output then you should be a little less confident in the\n",
      "decisions you make based on that data right if there's tons of variation you\n",
      "make a guess you could be way off and as long as you understand those things\n",
      "that you're you're taking a guess and the variation gives you a sense of how\n",
      "much confidence you should put in that guess you know bam that's great bam love\n",
      "it yeah and notice that nobody we never talked about the formula for variation\n",
      "right or the properties or anything even the notation variation is how far like\n",
      "if I throw a dart 100 times and I'm really good at hitting it there little\n",
      "variation but if I threw it all over the place there's a lot of variation that's\n",

      "has more variation exactly I love it I absolutely love it all right what else we\n",
      "got uh well there's one that I I don't know answer but I will still address it I\n",
      "have a question about Tesla send pipeline how does Tesla create the 3D onology\n",

      "kind of 3D version CNN do 2D this is like a 3D thing with different sensor\n",
      "inputs that's kind of when you want to where you want to go but I one of the\n",
      "many many many things that I don't know so yeah just just wanted to address that\n",
      "one yeah if we had uh yeah we had a Tesla employee we might be able to answer\n",
      "that one a little better good yeah let's see this one on F1 score yeah using F1\n",
      "to measure M performances by n uh are false negatives accounted for and can you\n",
      "give your intuition of when to use F1 score or other Alternatives I can say a\n",
      "little bit if you want to please please say something well uh I feel like n you\n",
      "know you can have I I like two models right like uh uh some of them have recall\n",
      "and some of them have good Precision uh for example if I have a a Spam model I\n",
      "want a good I I'm probably going to get them wrong but I want a good Precision\n",
      "because I don't want to get uh a a good email on my spam box right I don't mind\n",
      "getting spam email on my inbox but I don't want a good email on my spam box so I\n",
      "don't want is that a false positive or false negative uh I don't want one of\n",
      "them yeah and then if I have a medical model I want the opposite I don't want to\n",
      "tell a sick person that they're healthy I would be able to tell a health person\n",
      "that they're sick but not the opposite um so I don't want the opposite the false\n",
      "negatives or the false positives and so sometimes I I want both I want a bit of\n",
      "precision I want a bit of recall but Precision only measures precision and\n",
      "recall only measures recall whereas F1 score tells me if one of them is low it\n",
      "kind of rings a bell right it's kind of it's closer to the Min it's not the\n",
      "average because the average is bad because if I have too much if I have really\n",
      "good precision and really bad recall then the average is is high yeah but the F1\n",
      "score kind of goes it's it's an average but that's closer to the minimum yeah so\n",
      "it rings a bell so I always do F1 score because it tells me when something is\n",
      "when one of them is really low it's the harmonic mean actually the harmonic mean\n",
      "between two numbers is it's not the average but it's it's instead of X Plus y\n",
      "over 2 it's uh I think it's 2 ID 1X plus one over y it's an average that if\n",
      "they're the same is the same but if they're different it's weighted towards the\n",
      "the the smallest one so yeah definitely always use F1 score other Alternatives\n",
      "you know you can change the one right like if you want more to Precision go F2\n",
      "F10 if you want more to recall do F f110 or F1 and I probably mix them up again\n",
      "I will always mix those two up uh if I'm if I'm put on the spot but with F1 it\n",
      "you don't actually you just need to know that something's off and you know that\n",
      "one on off which is what you need and then you can start rumaging around and\n",
      "find out what's going on right but it's a rings a bell yeah yeah leou you get\n",
      "another bam I'm getting bamed nice you're getting just getting so many bams I\n",
      "just I think that's Fant I love that I love the way you put it it rings a bell\n",
      "thank you thank you very much I yeah it's perfect I love that I'm getting vs\n",
      "okay there's an easy question and know I don't know if it's for you or for me\n",
      "but it's are you planning to to translate your book to Spanish uh which which\n",
      "one um the the my existing book already has a Spanish translation nice um the\n",
      "new book it's possible I'll translate into Spanish I'm already working on the\n",
      "Korean translation the Korean people are just like there's a publisher in Korea\n",
      "that's like already on it and they're sending me contracts and I don't even have\n",
      "the book done um Spanish was harder though I uh uh there wasn't a company that\n",
      "wanted to do it and so I actually did it on my own I didn't translate it myself\n",
      "what I did is there was a uh a friend of mine uh living in Colombia actually oh\n",
      "uh who did the translation just one chapter at a time it took about a year uh\n",
      "because it wasn't their full-time job they just did the best they could and then\n",
      "I S from that and I and I and from that I then sent it to a statistics professor\n",
      "at the University of Barcelona and they went through and they made sure you know\n",
      "it sort of worked you know they they were basically the double check you know\n",
      "because I can't double check it um and and so we did get a Spanish version it\n",
      "was I will say it was very expensive and I've not yet broken even so yeah and so\n",
      "I'm going to if I can find a better way to translate it into Spanish I would\n",
